# ComfyUI Auto-Installer - TODO / Roadmap

> **Context:** This TODO was assembled during an infrastructure review.
> Updated 2026-03-21 — reflects the Python rewrite status.

---

## 1. Security

### ~~1.1 Network Exposure - `--listen` binds 0.0.0.0~~ ✅
> **Done:** `InstallerSettings.listen_address` defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Generated launchers use the setting.

### ~~1.2 Supply Chain - No Checksum Verification~~ ✅
> **Done:** SHA-256 checksums on all tools and wheels in `dependencies.json`. `download_file()` verifies checksums. All URLs point to HuggingFace Assets (primary) with ModelScope fallback.

### ~~1.3 Raw `pip` Usage~~ ✅
> **Done:** All package operations use `uv`. No pip calls remain.

### ~~1.4 DazzleML Script~~ ✅
> **Done:** Completely replaced. Direct wheel installs from PyPI/GitHub Releases with version mapping in `src/installer/optimizations.py`.

### ~~1.5 `Invoke-Expression` with Dynamic Strings~~ ✅
> **Done:** PowerShell scripts eliminated entirely. Python rewrite uses `subprocess.run()` with explicit argument lists.

### ~~1.6 Bootstrap Overwrites User Config~~ ✅
> **Done:** `InstallerSettings` (`local-config.json`) is never overwritten. Bootstrap creates from defaults only if missing.

### ~~1.7 `repo-config.json`~~ ✅
> **Done:** Folded into `InstallerSettings` (`gh_user`, `gh_reponame`, `gh_branch`). Old file deprecated.

### ~~1.8 Pickle/Tensor Model Scanner~~ ✅
> **Done:** `picklescan` dependency added. Scanner utility in `src/utils/model_scanner.py` detects malicious pickle code in `.ckpt`/`.pt`/`.pth` files. CLI command `scan-models` with Rich table output. Non-blocking warning integrated into update flow (step 5/5). 17 unit tests.

### ~~1.9 Admin Privilege Audit~~ ✅
> **Done:** Python rewrite requires zero admin elevation. Long paths enabled via registry user-level, VS Build Tools detected via `vswhere`.

---

## 2. Package Management

### ~~2.1 UV as Default Package Manager~~ ✅
> **Done:** `uv` is the sole package manager. Venv creation, installs, and editable installs all use `uv`.

### ~~2.2 Legacy Migration Path~~ → Not Needed
> **Rationale:** `python-rewrite` creates a fresh install — it does not upgrade existing PowerShell-based installs in-place. Users should do a clean install. No migration code required.

### ~~2.3 Constraints File Support~~ → Removed
> **Rationale:** `uv` handles dependency resolution natively and reliably. No user has ever requested this. Removing to reduce scope.

---

## ~~3. DazzleML Replacement~~ ✅

> **Done:** Entirely replaced by `src/installer/optimizations.py` — direct installs of SageAttention + triton-windows from PyPI.

### ~~3.1~~ ✅ Direct wheel install implemented
### ~~3.2~~ ✅ VS Build Tools optional — only needed for insightface source build
### ~~3.3~~ ✅ Compiler toolchain detection via vswhere
### ~~3.4 Track astral-sh Pyx~~ → Removed
> **Rationale:** Informational only, not actionable. Will be picked up naturally when/if Pyx ships.

---

## 4. Dependency Conflicts and Deprecation

### ~~4.1 `pynvml` vs `nvidia-ml-py` Conflict~~ ✅
> **Done:** `pynvml` removed from `dependencies.json`.

### ~~4.2 Deprecation Warnings Audit~~ → Removed
> **Rationale:** Cosmetic only, no user impact. Python rewrite uses modern APIs throughout. If warnings surface, they'll come from upstream dependencies and should be fixed there.

### ~~4.3 `custom_nodes.csv` - Dead Code~~ ✅
> **Done:** Replaced by `custom_nodes.json` manifest with additive-only logic.

---

## ~~5. Configuration Architecture~~ ✅

> **Done:** `InstallerSettings` (Pydantic model) loaded from/saved to `local-config.json`. Bootstrap creates only if missing. Contains: listen_address, listen_port, install_type, package_manager, gh_user, etc.

---

## 6. Reliability and Error Handling

### ~~6.1 Junction Creation - Unchecked~~ ✅
> **Done:** Python junction creation (`_create_junction()` in `install.py`) checks `os.path.isdir()` and raises on failure.

### ~~6.2 `SilentlyContinue` Hiding Failures~~ ✅
> **Done:** PowerShell eliminated. Python uses explicit error handling with `InstallerFatalError`.

### ~~6.3 Git Pull - No Conflict Handling~~ ✅
> **Done:** `run_and_log()` in `updater.py` uses `git pull --rebase --autostash` with proper error capture.

### ~~6.4 `Save-File` Assumes Existing Files Valid~~ ✅
> **Done:** `download_file()` checksums all downloads. Existing files re-verified.

### ~~6.5 CUDA Version Verification~~ ✅
> **Done:** `gpu.py` detects driver version, maps to maximum supported CUDA version, and `install.py` validates it against `dependencies.json`'s supported lists (including AMD ROCm/DirectML targets), offering intelligent fallbacks.

---

## ~~7. Code Quality~~ ✅

> **Done:** Python rewrite addressed all items — no more hardcoded paths, no `Invoke-Expression`, proper `subprocess.run()` with argument arrays, enums replace magic strings.

---

- [x] Automated testing on fresh Windows VMs (full install smoke test)
- [x] Docker build & smoke test (ubuntu-latest)
- [x] GHCR auto-publish on version tags

### ~~10.3 CI Release Automation~~ ✅
> **Done:** `release.yml` workflow triggered on `v*` tags — runs tests, builds sdist/wheel, publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing (OIDC), and creates GitHub Release with changelog notes and dist artifacts.
- [x] `release.yml` workflow — triggered on `v*` tags
- [x] Extract changelog section for the tag
- [x] Create GitHub Release with release notes
- [x] PyPI publish via Trusted Publishing (OIDC)

### ~~10.5 SageAttention CI~~ ✅
> **Done:** `build-sageattention.yml` workflow compiles SA2 (v2.2.0, `8.0+PTX`, Python 3.11/3.12/3.13) and SA3 (v1.0.0, sm_100 Blackwell). Wheels uploaded to HuggingFace Assets with automated manifest update. OOM resolved via single-arch + `MAX_JOBS=1`.
- [x] SA2 wheel builds (3 Python versions × sm_80+PTX)
- [x] SA3 Blackwell wheel build (Python 3.13 × sm_100)
- [x] Automated `tools_manifest.json` update with SHA256

### ~~10.6 Docker Lite Variant~~ ✅
> **Done:** `VARIANT=lite` and `VARIANT=lite-cloud` produce ~2 GB images without pre-installed PyTorch. Entrypoint auto-detects missing venv and runs full install on first boot. Cached in persistent volume for instant subsequent boots.
- [x] Conditional `VARIANT` in Dockerfile (skip PyTorch install)
- [x] Entrypoint first-run detection (`! -d /app/scripts/venv`)
- [x] Docker publish workflow builds all 4 variants
- [x] JupyterLab bash default + trash disabled

> **Done:** `MacOSPlatform` implemented. Native MPS/CPU handled automatically without CUDA contamination. Badge added to README. Tests added.

### ~~10.5 `--dry-run` Mode~~ → Removed
> **Rationale:** No user demand. The `--yes` flag + `--verbose` provides sufficient visibility into what the installer does. Removing to reduce scope.

## 11. Open Issues (User Reports)

### 11.1 SageAttention SM89 kernel missing (RTX 40xx)
- **Reported:** 2026-03-24
- **Symptom:** `"Error running sage attention: SM89 kernel is not available. Make sure you GPUs with compute capability 8.9., using pytorch attention instead."`
- **Root cause:** `build-sageattention.yml` compiles with `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.0+PTX`. SageAttention 2.x uses **separate C extension modules** per SM (`sm80_compile`, `sm89_compile`, `sm90_compile`). PTX JIT doesn't help because the Python extension module `sm89_compile.so/.pyd` is never compiled — only `sm80_compile` is built.
- **Fix:** Change `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` to `"8.0;8.6;8.9;9.0+PTX"` in both Linux and Windows SA2 build jobs.
- **Affected GPUs:** All RTX 40xx (sm_89 / Ada Lovelace). Possibly RTX 3060/3070/3080 too (sm_86).
- [ ] Update `build-sageattention.yml` with multi-arch build
- [ ] Rebuild and upload new wheels to HuggingFace Assets
- [ ] Update `tools_manifest.json` checksums

### 11.2 UV bootstrap fails silently on non-standard install paths
- **Reported:** 2026-03-24
- **Symptom:** Installation on `D:\` drive stalls — user had to install `uv` manually to continue.
- **Root cause:** `Install.bat` Step 2 downloads `uv.exe` via `curl` + `tar`, but does not verify the extraction succeeded. If `curl` or `tar` fails silently, Step 3 tries to use a non-existent `%UV_EXE%` and fails.
- **Fix:** Add a post-extraction check: `if not exist "%UV_EXE%" (echo [ERROR] uv extraction failed & pause & exit /b 1)` after line 112.
- [ ] Add `uv.exe` existence check after extraction in `Install.bat`
- [ ] Add equivalent check in `Install.sh`

## Priority Order (Updated 2026-03-24)

- **11.1** SageAttention SM89 — Blocking for RTX 40xx users (majority of user base)
- **11.2** UV bootstrap — Edge case but causes silent install failure
