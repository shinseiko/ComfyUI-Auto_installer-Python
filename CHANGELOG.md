## [5.1.8] — UV Pip Dependency

### Fixed

- **Wheel installation failed without `uv`** — Installing the global package via `pip install umeairt-comfyui-installer` bypasses the `Install.bat` bootstrap script, which was responsible for downloading the `uv` executable. The installer then incorrectly crashed at Step 7 because `uv` was missing. We have now added `uv` as a core pip dependency in `pyproject.toml` so it is automatically installed and detected alongside the installer.

## [5.1.7] — Windows Path Parsing Fix


### Fixed

- **Windows install path backslashes removed** — Fixed a bug where standard Windows paths with backslashes (e.g. `D:\Dev\ComfyUI`) had their backslashes stripped by `shlex.split` under the hood, resulting in invalid paths like `D:DevComfyUI`. TUI now passes arguments as a list to avoid shell parsing issues entirely.

## [5.1.6] — TUI Install Path Fix


### Fixed

- **Install path ignored from TUI** — When launching an installation from the TUI Manager menu, the installer CLI would override the user's chosen installation path with the current working directory. The TUI arguments are now correctly prioritized.

## [5.1.5] — Self-Contained Wheel (fix #7)


### Fixed

- **Wheel install was completely broken** — `pip install umeairt-comfyui-installer` crashed immediately at Step 2 with `FileNotFoundError` because the `scripts/` configuration directory was never included in the wheel. The installer was only functional when run from a source checkout. (Fixes #7)

### Changed

- **`find_source_scripts()` returns `Path | None`** — no longer raises `FileNotFoundError`; callers handle absence gracefully. Lookup order: embedded package data (wheel) → `scripts/` at project root (editable install) → `CWD/scripts/` (CI).
- **`scripts/` config files embedded in wheel via `force-include`** — `dependencies.json`, `custom_nodes.json`, `environment.yml`, `nunchaku_versions.json`, `comfy.settings.json`, and `banner.txt` are bundled at build time from the `scripts/` directory (single source of truth, no duplication in the repo).
- **424 tests** — up from 422 (all passing). Added tests for `None` return path, `importlib.resources` fallback, and embedded data detection.

## [5.1.4] — Blackwell SageAttention 3 & Data Protection

### Fixed

- **SageAttention 3 never installed on Blackwell GPUs** — The installer stopped after installing the first matching wheel (SageAttention 2), never reaching the SageAttention 3 entry. Now iterates **all** matching wheels, so RTX 50XX users get both SA2 (stable INT8/FP16) and SA3 (experimental FP4). Older GPUs are unaffected (single match per architecture).
- **Partial install cleanup could delete user data** — Interrupted installations on existing setups (migration, reinstall) could wipe models, outputs, and custom nodes. Added a `_fresh_install` marker file to distinguish fresh installs from migrations, ensuring user data is never deleted during cleanup.
- **Active venv deleted during partial install cleanup** — The cleanup logic could remove the `scripts/` directory containing the running venv, causing cascading failures. Now explicitly preserves `scripts/venv/` and only removes the parent directory when truly empty.
- **Empty `scripts/` directory left after cleanup** — Fresh install cleanup removed directory contents but left the empty shell, causing test failures.
- **Unicode em-dashes in migration script** — `Migrate-from-PS.ps1` used Unicode em-dashes (`—`) which broke on systems with non-UTF-8 PowerShell encoding. Replaced with ASCII hyphens. (Closes #2)
- **Lint errors** — Moved `Path` import into `TYPE_CHECKING` block (TC003), removed trailing whitespace (W293).

### Changed

- **SageAttention installer checks per-package** — Instead of a single global "already installed?" check, each wheel entry is verified individually, preventing redundant downloads during updates.
- **430 tests** — up from 426 (all passing).

## [5.1.3] — Migration Script & Node Requirements Fix

### Added

- **PowerShell → Python migration script** — `Migrate-from-PS.ps1` standalone 6-step migration script. Auto-detects PS installations, preserves all user data (models, outputs, custom nodes), cleans PS infrastructure, and bootstraps the Python environment. One-liner: `irm https://get.umeai.art/migrate.ps1 | iex`.
- **`reinstall_all_node_requirements()`** — New function in `nodes.py` that scans all `custom_nodes/` subdirectories and installs their `requirements.txt` via `uv`. Used after venv recreation (migration, `--reinstall`).
- **Migration documentation** — `docs/migration.md` MkDocs guide with step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting, and manual migration path. README sections added to both Python and PowerShell repos.
- **6 new tests** — `reinstall_all_node_requirements` (4 tests), `install_node` existing+requirements (1), `update_all_nodes` user node requirements (1).

### Fixed

- **`nvidia-smi` GPU detection failure** — Added a PyTorch-based fallback for detecting GPUs and computing capabilities. This ensures optimizations like SageAttention are installed correctly and the TUI info menu accurately displays the GPU even when `nvidia-smi` fails or misses details (Fixes #6).
- **`install_node()` did not reinstall requirements for existing nodes** — During migration or `--reinstall`, nodes already present on disk had their Python dependencies skipped entirely. Now requirements are always installed regardless of clone status. **(Critical fix)**
- **`update_all_nodes()` ignored user-installed node dependencies** — User-installed nodes (not in manifest) with `requirements.txt` now have their dependencies reinstalled during updates.
- **`find_uv()` failed to detect local `scripts/uv/`** — Auto-detection now works from CWD when `install_path` is not explicitly passed.
- **`uv` not found in TUI System Info** — `install_path` derived from `python_exe` to locate the local `uv` binary.
- **InsightFace installed from source on Windows** — Skipped from standard `pip install` packages; uses pre-compiled wheel instead.
- **HuggingFace CI uploads failed on 412** — Retry logic with exponential backoff for `Precondition Failed` errors.

### Changed

- **426 tests** — up from 416 (all passing).

## [5.1.2] — SageAttention Per-Architecture Builds & Bootstrap Fallback

### Added

- **Per-architecture SageAttention wheels** — SM80, SM86, SM89, SM90 (Linux), SM100 (RTX 5090) each get a dedicated wheel with natively compiled CUDA kernels. Resolves "SM89 kernel not available" errors on RTX 40XX GPUs.
- **SM100 (Blackwell) support** — SA2 builds for RTX 5090 on both Linux and Windows.
- **Bootstrap triple-source fallback** — `get.umeai.art` scripts now try GitHub (git), then HuggingFace (ZIP), then ModelScope (ZIP). Git is no longer a hard prerequisite on Windows.
- **Release ZIP mirroring** — `release.yml` now uploads a `latest.zip` source archive to HuggingFace and ModelScope for fallback downloads.
- **Bootstrap integrity check** — verifies `Install.bat` and `pyproject.toml` presence after download.

### Fixed

- **SageAttention checksum verification** — two-pass lookup (full path first, basename fallback) prevents stale checksums from the old flat manifest entry.
- **InsightFace wheel restored** — pre-compiled Windows wheel reinstated in `dependencies.json` (was incorrectly moved to standard packages).
- **UV detection** — `find_uv()` now checks the local `scripts/uv/` directory before the system PATH, correctly detecting the bootstrap-installed binary.
- **ModelScope uploads** — removed invalid `endpoint=` parameter from `upload_file()` calls; endpoint is set on `HubApi()` constructor.
- **SM90 Windows builds removed** — Hopper GPUs (H100/H200) are datacenter-only Linux hardware.

### Changed

- **416 tests** — all passing.

## [5.1.0] — TUI Manager & Launcher Consolidation

### Added

- **TUI Manager** — Full terminal UI (`umeairt-comfyui-installer` with no subcommand) built with Textual, featuring:
  - **Home screen** — Detect installed ComfyUI, show Launch / Update / Download / Reinstall / Info options.
  - **Launch screen** — VRAM mode selector (Performance / Normal / Low) with GPU VRAM auto-detection, listen address, SageAttention toggle, auto-browser toggle — all on a single row.
  - **Download screen** — Interactive model bundle browser with variant selection and progress tracking.
  - **Install screen** — Path input and environment type selection for fresh installs.
  - **Info screen** — System info display (GPU, Python, installed packages).
- **`UserSettings` model** (`src/settings.py`) — Persistent JSON-based user preferences for listen address, VRAM mode, SageAttention, auto-browser, and extra args.
- **`--reinstall` flag** — Clean reinstall option that preserves models and output data.
- **`UmeAiRT-Manager` script** — Single launcher replacing `UmeAiRT-Update` + `UmeAiRT-Download-Models` scripts. Opens the TUI manager.
- **23 new tests** for `UserSettings` — defaults, save/load round-trip, corrupt file handling, all VRAM modes, DirectML detection, extra args.

### Changed

- **Launcher consolidation** — 4 generated scripts → 3: Performance, LowVRAM, Manager (one entry point for update, download, reinstall, settings).
- **Settings merged into Launcher** — Listen address, SageAttention, and auto-browser settings moved from a separate Settings screen into the Launch screen.
- **Portable bundle** — `UmeAiRT-Download-Models.bat` replaced by `UmeAiRT-Manager.bat` (launches TUI).
- **Coverage** — `src/tui/*` excluded from CI coverage (interactive terminal widgets). Total coverage maintained at 70%+.
- **416 tests** — up from 393 (all passing).

### Fixed

- **20 ruff lint errors** in TUI files (TC003, F401, SIM105, SIM117, E501).
- **3 bandit warnings** — `# nosec B104` for user-chosen `0.0.0.0` bind address, `# nosec B605` for static `os.system("cls")`.
- **Stale imports** — Removed `SettingsScreen` import and F2 binding from `app.py`.
- **Test failures** — Updated tool script count (2→1), network prompt test, snapshot tests.

## [5.0.0] — Stable Release

### Changed

- **Version bump** — `5.0.0a3` → `5.0.0` (Production/Stable).
- **Docstrings** — `run_install()` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now reference "13 steps" (was "12").
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Fixed repository clone URL to `ComfyUI-Auto_installer-Python`.

### Removed

- **`bootstrap/` legacy folder** — 4 unused scripts (`install.bat`, `install.sh`, `remote-install.ps1`, `remote-install.sh`) from the PowerShell era. The real entry points are `Install.bat` and `Install.sh` at the project root.

## [5.0.0-alpha.3] — SageAttention CI & Docker Lite

### Added

- **SageAttention CI workflow** — `build-sageattention.yml` compiles SA2 (v2.2.0, sm_80+PTX for Python 3.11/3.12/3.13) and SA3 (v1.0.0, sm_100 Blackwell) wheels. Automated manifest update job uploads wheels + SHA256 checksums to HuggingFace Assets.
- **Docker lite variant** — `docker build --build-arg VARIANT=lite` produces a ~2 GB image without pre-installed PyTorch. The entrypoint detects missing venv and runs a full install on first boot (~5-10 min), then caches in the persistent volume. Also available as `lite-cloud` with JupyterLab.
- **Docker image variants** — 4 published images: `latest`, `latest-cloud`, `latest-lite`, `latest-lite-cloud`.
- **JupyterLab bash default** — Jupyter terminals default to bash via `--ServerApp.terminado_settings`.
- **JupyterLab trash disabled** — `--FileContentsManager.delete_to_trash=False` saves disk space in containers.
- **Entrypoint first-run detection** — checks for `/app/scripts/venv` existence to decide whether to run initial install.

### Changed

- **Docker base image** — switched from `nvidia/cuda:13.0.2-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu24.04` to `nvidia/cuda:13.0.2-runtime-ubuntu24.04` (cuDNN removed — PyTorch bundles its own).
- **Docker build optimization** — lite variants skip `build-essential` and `python3.12-dev` entirely, standard variants include them for compilation.
- **CI SageAttention images** — switched from `cudnn-devel` to `devel` (cuDNN unnecessary for CUDA kernel compilation).
- **SageAttention build strategy** — SA2 uses `8.0+PTX` (single native arch + PTX forward compat) to prevent OOM errors during CI compilation.
- **`.dockerignore` expanded** — excludes `.github/`, `docs/`, `bootstrap/`, IDE configs, and `docker-compose.yml`.
- **`dependencies.json`** — updated SageAttention wheel entries with correct HuggingFace URLs, versions (SA2 2.2.0, SA3 1.0.0), and SHA256 checksums.
- **406 tests** — up from 369 (all passing).

### Fixed

- **SageAttention CI OOM** — compilation now uses `MAX_JOBS=1` and single-arch `8.0+PTX` strategy.
- **HuggingFace repo name** — corrected `HF_REPO` to `UmeAiRT/ComfyUI-Auto-Installer-Assets`.
- **SA3 wheel build** — fixed `setup.py bdist_wheel` for subdirectory package structure.

## [5.0.0-alpha.2] — Hardening & Optimization Engine

### Added

- **Config-driven optimizations** — `optimizations.packages[]` in `dependencies.json` replaces hardcoded Triton/SageAttention logic. Supports per-platform packages, GPU/OS filters (`requires`), torch version constraints, and retry options. Adding a new optimization = 1 JSON block, zero Python code.
- **FlashAttention** — added as a Linux+NVIDIA-only package via the new optimization engine.
- **`skip_step()` logger** — `InstallerLogger.skip_step()` decrements `total_steps` and logs a dimmed message when a step is conditionally skipped, keeping the progress counter accurate.
- **Docker cloud variant** — `docker build --build-arg VARIANT=cloud` adds JupyterLab alongside ComfyUI for RunPod/cloud deployments. Runtime env vars: `JUPYTER_ENABLE`, `JUPYTER_TOKEN`, `JUPYTER_PORT`.
- **Docker `NODE_TIER`** — environment variable to control which custom node bundle installs at container startup (`minimal`, `umeairt`, `full`). Also added `--nodes` flag to the `update` CLI command.
- **GHCR auto-publish** — `docker-publish.yml` workflow builds and pushes both `standard` and `cloud` Docker images to `ghcr.io/umeairt/comfyui` on version tags.
- **80 new tests** — 6 new test files covering `commands`, `prompts`, `nodes`, `updater`, `gpu`, and `download` modules.

### Changed

- **Docker: CUDA 13.0 runtime** — base image changed from `python:3.12-slim` (CPU-only) to `nvidia/cuda:13.0.2-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu24.04` for full RTX 50X0/40X0/30X0 GPU support.
- **Docker: standalone uv** — replaced `pip install uv` with the standalone binary via `curl` (matches bootstrap approach).
- **Docker: fast startup** — replaced `user: root` + `chown -R` at every boot with `user: "1000:1000"` (fixed UID created at build time).
- **Error handling** — `SystemExit(1)` in updater replaced with `InstallerFatalError` for consistent error handling.
- **Explicit `cuda_tag`** — removed hardcoded `"cu130"` defaults from `install_core_dependencies`, `install_python_packages`, `install_wheels` function signatures.
- **macOS PyTorch** — improved package detection to derive names dynamically instead of relying on fragile string matching.
- **Install.sh** — aligned with `Install.bat` by adding `--python-preference only-system` as first venv creation attempt.
- **CI coverage threshold** — bumped from 55% to 70%.

### Fixed

- **Docker: CRLF line endings** — `entrypoint.sh` broken on Linux due to Windows `\r\n` endings. Fixed by adding `sed -i 's/\r$//'` in Dockerfile and `.gitattributes` enforcing LF on `.sh` files.
- **Docker: PEP 668 compliance** — Ubuntu 24.04's "externally managed" Python marker removed to allow system-wide `uv pip install`.
- **Docker: smoke test** — CI test replaced HTTP health check (requires GPU) with static image content verification.
- Updater step counter becoming inaccurate when `custom_nodes.json` is missing (now uses `skip_step()`).
- Logger singleton state leaking between tests (added `autouse` reset fixture in `conftest.py`).
- Redundant import of `CommandError` in `nodes.py`.
- Extra blank lines between functions in `environment.py`.

## [5.0.0-alpha.1] — Python Rewrite

### Added

- **Universal Hardware Support** — Auto-detects and configs PyTorch for NVIDIA (CUDA 13.0/12.8), AMD (ROCm 7.1/DirectML), and Apple Silicon (MPS).
- **Full Python CLI** (`umeairt-comfyui-installer`) replacing all PowerShell scripts — commands: `install`, `update`, `download-models`, `info`, `version`.
- **Cross-platform support** — Windows (.bat), Linux/macOS (.sh) launchers and installer scripts.
- **Pydantic configuration** — typed, validated config models for `dependencies.json` and user settings.
- **Verbose mode** (`-v` / `--verbose`) — hides pip/git subprocess output by default, shows with flag.
- **Step counter** — `[Step X/12]` progress indicator across both installation phases.
- **Additive-only node manifest** (`custom_nodes.json`) — replaces destructive snapshot system. User-installed nodes are never removed.
- **Git clone retry** — 3 attempts with 300s timeout, shallow clone (`--depth 1`) on retries 2+.
- **Internalized Triton/SageAttention** — version-constrained installation based on PyTorch compatibility matrix (inspired by DazzleML).
- **Unified model downloader** — catalog-driven system replacing 8 separate PowerShell scripts.
- **Launcher generation** — 4 scripts generated at install time: Start (Performance), Start (LowVRAM), Download Models, Update.
- **Bootstrap version detection** — `Install.bat`/`Install.sh` compare installed vs repo version and prompt before updating.
- **GPU info command** — `umeairt-comfyui-installer info` displays GPU, VRAM, Python, and tool versions.
- **Agentic documentation** — `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `docs/codemaps/` with mermaid diagrams.
- **374 automated tests** — unit and integration tests with pytest, 70% coverage.
- **CI/CD pipeline** — Fast PR linting/testing matrix (`ci.yml`), plus a rigorous E2E manual workflow (`integration.yml`) that spins up a Windows VM, does a full install, and stream-validates all PyTorch/tool SHA-256 hashes.
- **Docker support** — `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` with CUDA 13.0 runtime and `--skip-nodes` for lightweight images. Custom nodes installed at runtime via entrypoint into persistent volumes. Docker CI smoke test in GitHub Actions.
- **Model security scanner** — `scan-models` CLI command using `picklescan` to detect malicious pickle code in `.ckpt`/`.pt`/`.pth` model files. Non-blocking warning integrated into the update flow.

### Changed

- **Architecture**: Migrated from PowerShell (`.ps1`) to Python (`src/`), reducing ~3700 lines of scripts.
- **Installer Isolation**: The bootstrap script (`install.bat`) now creates a dedicated, isolated `.installer_venv` to prevent polluting the global Python environment.
- **Path Mapping Engine**: The internal `PATH_TYPE_MAP` is now decoupled, allowing paths to be dynamically defined via `model_manifest.json`.
- **Node management**: `custom_nodes.json` (JSON manifest) replaces `custom_nodes.csv` + `snapshot.json`.
- **Dependency management**: `uv` as primary package manager with `pip` fallback.
- **Logging**: `InstallerLogger` with 4 levels (step/item/sub/info) replacing `Write-Log` PowerShell module.

### Removed

- All PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`, `.psm1`) — replaced by Python.
- `snapshot.json` — replaced by additive manifest.
- `custom_nodes.csv` — replaced by `custom_nodes.json`.
- `whl/` directory (28 MB of bundled wheels) — now downloaded via URL.
- External script download for Triton/SageAttention — security risk eliminated.
- Old root `.bat` launchers — now auto-generated at install time.

### Security

- **Eliminated external script execution** — no more downloading `.py` files from the internet and running them.
- **Secure subprocess calls** — all commands use explicit argument lists (no `shell=True`).
- **HTTPS only** — all download URLs validated.

### Fixed

- Double arrow prefix on uv/pip install log lines.
- Step counter overflow (was showing 10/9).
- Verbose flag not working with lowercase `-v`.
- Duplicate log lines for uv/pip commands.
- Git clone timeouts on larger repositories.
